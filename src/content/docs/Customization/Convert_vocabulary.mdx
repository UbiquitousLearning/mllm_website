To start the conversion process, you need to have Python (3.8+) installed and install the required packages.

```bash
cd tools/convertor
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

To convert the vocabulary to mllm vocabulary, follow these steps. We currently support two types of tokenizers: Unigram and BPE.

```bash
python vocab.py --input_file=tokenizer.model --output_file=vocab.mllm --type=Unigram
```
